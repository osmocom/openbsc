To run the configuration parsing and output (VTY) test suite, first install

  git://git.osmocom.org/python/osmo-python-tests

and pass the following configure options here:

  ./configure --enable-vty-tests --enable-external-tests

The VTY tests are then included in the standard check target:

  make check
