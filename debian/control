Package: osmocom-bsc-sccplite
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends}
Description: GSM Base Station Controller
 This is the BSC-only version of OpenBSC. It requires a Mobile Switching Center
 (MSC) to operate.
 .
 You might rather prefer to use osmocom-nitb which is considered a
 "GSM Network-in-a-Box" and does not depend on a MSC.
