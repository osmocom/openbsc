Package: osmocom-bsc-sccplite
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends}
Description: GSM Base Station Controller
 This is the BSC-only version of OpenBSC. It requires a Mobile Switching Center
 (MSC) to operate.
 .
 You might rather prefer to use osmocom-nitb which is considered a
 "GSM Network-in-a-Box" and does not depend on a MSC.

Package: osmocom-nitb
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends},
         libdbd-sqlite3
Description: GSM Network-in-a-Box, implements BSC, MSC, SMSC, HLR, VLR
 This is the Network-in-a-Box version of OpenBSC. It has all the GSM network
 components bundled together. When using osmocom-nitb, there is no need for a
 Mobile Switching Center (MSC) which is needed when using osmocom-bsc-sccplite.

Package: osmocom-ipaccess-utils
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends}
Description: Command line utilities for ip.access nanoBTS
 This package contains utilities that are specific for nanoBTS when being used
 together with OpenBSC. It contains mainly three tools: ipaccess-find,
 ipaccess-config and ipaccess-proxy.

Package: osmocom-bs11-utils
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends}
Description: Command line utilities for Siemens BS-11 BTS
 There is a tool in this package for configuring the Siemens BS-11 BTS.
 Additionally, it contains one tool for making use of an ISDN-card and the
 public telephone network as frequency standard for the E1 line.

Package: osmocom-bsc-nat
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends},
         ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: osmocom-bsc-sccplite
Description: Osmocom Base Station Controller Network Address Translation
 This NAT is useful for masquerading multiple BSCs behind one. It listens
 for incoming BSCs on port 5000 and connects to a specified Mobile Switching
 Center (MSC).
 .
 This package is part of OpenBSC and closely related to osmocom-bsc-sccplite.

Package: openbsc-dev
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Header file needed by tools tightly integrated
 Some other programs depend on gsm_data_shared.h and gsm_data_shared.c
 from OpenBSC. This package installs these files to your file system so
 that the other packages can build-depend on this package.
 .
 The directory structure is copied after the structure in the repository
 and the header and .c file are installed into /usr/src/osmocom/openbsc/.
